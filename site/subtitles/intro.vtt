Hi my name is Drew,

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
and I am the maintainer of Sway,

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a tiling Wayland compositor.

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Sway is compatible with the i3 window manager.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It uses the same configuration syntax

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and supports most software that is designed for i3.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The difference is that sway uses Wayland instead of Xorg.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Wayland is the next generation

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of display servers

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for Linux and related operating systems.

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It is more efficient, more secure

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and easier for developers to work with.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's take a quick tour

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of some of the features of sway.

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you are familiar with i3,

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
some of this might not be new to you.

17
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'll start by opening my web browser.

18
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

19
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Sway will arrange it,

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to use all of the available space.

21
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If I open more windows,

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Sway will rearrange things accordingly.

23
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I can move between these with the keyboard.

24
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can ask Sway to arrange them vertically,

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
horizontally,

26
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
tabbed,

27
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or stacked.

28
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

29
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I can change their sizes with the keyboard too.

30
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

31
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I can also split windows

32
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
into containers of several windows.

33
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So far I haven't touched the mouse.

35
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If I wanted to, though,

36
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I can use it to manipulate these windows.

37
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
[various background noises]

38
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It is also possible to take windows

39
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
outside the tiling area

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and manipulate them entirely with the mouse.

41
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[various background noises and some keyboard clicks]

42
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Sway also includes features

43
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
you may recognize from prominent i3 forks,

44
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
such as gaps.

45
00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

46
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Also included are compatible equivalents

47
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
from important i3 programs

48
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
like swaybar,

49
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

50
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
swaylock,

51
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

52
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and swaymsg,

53
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
as well as some programs unique to sway

54
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
such as swaygrab.

55
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:19.000
[sound of clicking keyboard]

56
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We only scratched the surface

57
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of what Sway could do.

58
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We have lots of great docs

59
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that will help you learn more.

60
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Today Sway supports almost all

61
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of i3s features.

62
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Give it a shot!
